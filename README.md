# ML_case_study
Machine Learning case study for data engineering practice.


**Case Study:**

_This case consists of a supervised learning example. The task is to predict the probability of default for the datapoints where the default variable is not set. The answer should contain the resulting predictions in a csv file with two columns,
uuid and pd (probability of default==1). Once done expose this model with an API Endpoint on a cloud provider of choice. Bonus points if AWS is used. Show the details on how to query the endpoint, attach code used for modelling, a short (max one page) explanation of the model and how it was validated._

_Use mostly Python for modeling but feel free to use other languages if prefered as long as they are easily obtainable. Donâ€™t spend too much time on the prediction results. Evaluation is based on how it is structured and the reasoning about the problem rather than the predictive accuracy of the model._
